Question 1: Why can't the two tasks run concurrently, even when one of the functions is not
doing anything (sleeping)?

Currently, the code is running on a single thread, meaning that the CPU executes 
only one task at a time. Even though the mysum() function may be sleeping between 
iterations, the entire program is sequential because the second function myaverage()
will only start after the first function has fully completed. For true concurrency,
multiple threads are needed, as a single-threaded program cannot execute more 
han one function simultaneously. By using threads, each function could run in
parallel, allowing both tasks to progress independently, even when one is idle.
